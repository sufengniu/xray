this is tif file loading, mpi library based parallel computing

mpi library and pthread library are used
make sure your cluster has the same version of Linux
to check it:
file /usr/bin/file
also check the Linux arch by:
uname -m

try to check MPI version by:
ldd /your/mpi/bin/directory/hydra_pmi_proxy

the dir is listed below:

ctest: a list of tested submodules using C style. 
|-- cpu_info: 	read out cpu core number and its information
|-- dark_rms: 	old version of C code for dark mode, perform average and root mean square
|		it will generate average image and stand derivation image, using multi threads
|		and thread pool
|-- data_sub:	old version of C code for both dark mode and data mode. after generating dark
|		image, it performs data mode, which perform lld function, using thread pool
|-- libtiff_load: first version of tif read	
|-- tifseq_load: function to load multiple tif file 
|-- mthread_dark_avg: first version of dark average operation using multi threads
|-- mthread_dark_rms: first version of dark rms operation using multi threads
|-- udp:	udp socket programming performs udp send and udp receive
|-- mpi_lld:	pure MPI based perform dark mode, data mode and udp send and receive
|-- op_scatter:	MPI and multi threads hybrid programming model using scatter function to assign
|		image strips
`-- op_rma:	MPI and multi threads hybrid programming model using remote memory acess technique
