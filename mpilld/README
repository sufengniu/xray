this is sufeng's preferred version of mpi based
dark rms/ averaging
and lld compression.

type make to make

main.c has the main function.

we first run the mpi program  in an xterm.
 ./run.perl main

in another xterm we run

./udp_client 55Fe_run5.tif

The udp client will send images to the main prog, which will do 
lld compression

as of now, the main prog is in lld mode. there is also a dark average
mode.


There is a file called host file:

more hostfile
iocfccd1:7

hostfile defines the mpi server name and number of cores to use.

To use 10G link. Set host file to:
10.0.5.50:7

Do ifconfig to see all the net devices
eth5 is the 10GB link on fccdioc1


To see config and speed of card from the bootup messages:

dmesg | grep eth5 | less

There is a perl program that runs everything.
Prog is called run.main.

There is a line,
%program_nodes = ("main", 7);

that must be set to run on 7 cores. So there are two places to set cores,
in hostfiles and run.main

The perl program just runs this program:

mpiexec -n 7 -f hostfile ./main


The code is all in /mnt
The reason for this is that verious servers have to have access to a shared area on the disk. and mnt is shared over NFS

So mpiexec and main are on the mnt area.


note that all the mpi libs are in  /mnt
the mpi compiler is mpicc, and is in mnt also.

for help do 
man mpiexec

Still a prob w. iocfccd1, iocfccd3 conn. sufeng is working on it.

In /mnt/mpi
Totalview is the debugger, that is expired
mpich-install is mpi libs

lab is sufengs work




To debug the program
totalview is expensive and out of license. so sufeng found another way.

To launch 7 cores, each core gets an xterm. Then we can see each thing run. It uses
gdb to debug, so we can break each thread running...
mpiexec -np 7 xterm -e gdb main



There are bad areas in fccd camera
so in sub.c there is code to mask it out...
